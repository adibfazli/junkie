# Junkie App

## Description:

A place where collectors can go to to input their collection, organize, share, buy and sell thier items with other likeminded collectors. Today we are starting with Vinyl Record junkies, tomorrow it will be comics and in the future you will have every collection.

You can input the album information into your collection, including grade and description. Organize your collection and search your collection. Other users can comment on your collection. Once you find a better vinyl then the one you have you can put that one up for sale on our Junkie Market.
